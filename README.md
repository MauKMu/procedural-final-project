## TODO

- ~~Adjust position after `terrain.collide()` so player moves at constant-ish speed regardless of slope~~
- ~~Mouse controls~~
- More stuff in level
  - ~~Add big VBO for drawing "decorations" like in L-system~~
  - Add tile-based "acceleration structure"
  - Add buildings?
- Maybe add jumping? Probably after adding collision w/ non-terrain entities
- Investigate weird precision bug that causes crashes if Player spawns at X = 0 and moves forward
